\section{VALET Pipeline}
VALET flags regions as potential mis-assemblies when the characteristics of the sequence data do not meet the assumptions for the sequence generation process regarding (1) depth of coverage, (2) insert size consistency, and (3) alignability of the sequences (Figure~\ref{fig:valet_pipeline}). 
Regions that share multiple mis-assembly signatures may be more likely an \textit{actual} mis-assembly.

\subsection{Depth of Coverage Analysis}
The sequencing process of randomly-sheared fragments follows a Poisson distribution~\citep{lander1988genomic}.  Regions within assembled contigs that show high variance in coverage may be potential mis-assemblies. 
Areas of high and low depths of coverage could be compressed/expanded repeats, chimeric contigs, and other types of contamination. 
The main benefit of this approach is that it is completely data-dependent. No prior assumptions of the distribution of the quality values need to be made.

\subsection{Insert size consistency}
Although the sequence technology can only give the raw sequence of the first couple hundred basepairs from the ends of the fragment, the distance between the ends of the sequences can be used to aid in resolving repeats, and orienting and scaffolding contigs. 
Regions of an assembly containing a disproportionate number of mate-pairs (reads from the same fragment) with incorrect insert sizes may be a potential mis-assembly.

\subsection{Identifying assembly breakpoints}
The reads given to the assembler should be alignable to the resulting assembly.
During sequencing, reads are produced starting from random locations within the genome.
Thus, the reads must be able to align to the resulting assembly.
In practice, however, a read may fail to align for a few reasons.
When a read is unable to align to an assembly, there must be some explanation.
In metagenomic samples, an unaligned read can be from a rare, low coverage organism, and was never assembled with any other reads.
A read with a large amount of errors will be unable to align within a specified similarity to the assembly.
A read can come from a unfiltered contaminant or primer.
If a read does not fall into one of the above categories, then it may be a sign of a potential mis-assembly.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Definition of a mis-assembly}
We compared misassemblies identified by VALET on a simulated and synthetic metagenomic dataset to the reference based metagenome assembly evaluation tool MetaQUAST~citep{mikheenko2015metaquast}.
We ran VALET on the assemblies and compared the errors found with the reference-based mis-assemblies detected by MetaQUAST.
MetaQUAST uses the Plantagora’s definition of a mis-assembly,
i.e., a mis-assembly breakpoint is defined as a position in the assembled contigs where (1) the left flanking
sequence aligns over 1kb away from right flanking sequence on the reference, or (2) the sequences overlap by
over 1kb, or (3) the right flanking sequence aligns on opposite strands or different chromosomes. 
As mutations in the strain in a metagenome can contain structural variants relative to the reference genome. 
MetaQUAST uses the read mapping structural variant caller MANTA~\citep{chen2015manta} to filter canidate misassemblies. 
If any part of a region flagged by VALET overlaps with a mis-assembled region reported by MetaQUAST, we consider it a true positive (mis-assembly correctly identified by our method).
%In addition, the N50 of each assembly is recalculated after breaking at mis-assemblies found by QUAST.

%Does window length matter when comparing assemblies.

We examine the sensitivity of VALET on a toy mock metagenomic community consisting of four bacteria at varying abundances: 80X \emph{Bacteroides vulgatus}  ATCC8482 (Accn. NC_009614.1), 60X \emph{Bacillus cereus} (Accn. NC_003909.8), 40X \emph{Actinomyces odontolyticus} (Accn. NZ_DS264586.1), and 20X \emph{Acinetobacter baumannii} (Accn. NC_009085.1).
Approximately four million reads are simulated using \textsc{wgsim}~\citep{li2013wgsim} with default parameters and 100 bp forward and reverse reads.
The dataset was assembled using Velvet~\citep{zerbino2008velvet}, MetaVelvet~\citep{namiki2012metavelvet}, MaSuRCA~\citep{zimin2013masurca}, and SOAPdenovo2~\citep{luo2012soapdenovo2} by MetAMOS~\citep{treangen2013metamos}.

Across all assemblers, VALET detects greater than 80\% of mis-assemblies detected by MetaQUAST (Table~\ref{simulated_community}).% with all mis-assemblies being found in the IDBA-UD and SOAPdenovo2 assemblies.
%IDBA-UD, MetaVelvet, and SPAdes assemblies contain roughly the same amount of sequence (16.3-16.5 Mbp), while SOAPdenovo2 contains roughly 4 Mbp less.
IDBA-UD has the greatest N50 after breaking the assembly at regions marked by QUAST (206.7 Kbp), followed by SPAdes (128.1 Kbp), MetaVelvet (29.5 Kbp), and SOAPdenovo2 (10.8 Kbp).

\subsection{VALET accurately evaluates assemblies of a synthetic metagenomic community}

A major challenge of evaluating assemblies of environmental datasets is that a sizeable portion of the organsisms are unknown or lack a draft genome to compare against.
In silico simulations often lack the complexity and sequencing biases present in real environmental samples.
Fortunately, Shakya et al. provide a \emph{gold standard} synthetic metagenomic dataset containing a mixture of 64 organisms (16 members of Archaea and 48 organisms from 18 Bacteria phyla) with complete or high-quality draft genomes and 200-fold differences in abundances~\citep{shakya2013comparative}.
The dataset consists of 53.4 million reads (101 bp in length).
We assembled the dataset using Velvet~\citep{zerbino2008velvet}, MetaVelvet~\citep{namiki2012metavelvet}, SPAdes~\citep{bankevich2012spades}, and SOAPdenovo2~\citep{luo2012soapdenovo2} by MetAMOS~\citep{treangen2013metamos}.
We run VALET on the assemblies and compare the errors found with those reference-based mis-assemblies detected by QUAST (Table~\ref{synthetic_valet}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TODO Update assembly values
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
While the MEGAHIT and Omega assemblies are close in total size (192.3 Mbp vs. 194 Mbp, respectively), MEGAHIT has nearly twice as many contigs as Omega (19,145 vs. 10,284).
QUAST detects far more mis-assemblies in the Omega assembly compared to MEGAHIT (56,917 vs. 770, respectively).
VALET detects 34.80\% and 96.10\% of these mis-assemblies found by QUAST in the MEGAHIT and Omega assemblies, respectively.
While Omega has a higher N50 than MEGAHIT (44.1 Kbp vs. 38.9 Kbp), after breaking at mis-assemblies, the N50 drops well below MEGAHIT's (11.9 Kbp vs. 33.5 Kbp), illustrating why the N50 metric is not always a good indicator of assembly quality.
VALET is able to accurately assess the quality of the two assemblies without using the reference genomes.

\subsection{Mis-assemblies not validated by QUAST}
%% Is this for the synthetic comminity?
We investigate the high false positive rate by examining a small number of regions flagged by VALET, but not marked by QUAST within the MEGAHIT assembly.
One contig, roughly 25 Kbp in size, had a 5 Kbp region at the start of the contig marked as high coverage (Figure~\ref{fig:rrna_coverages}).
This region was roughly 4x the median coverage of the remaining contig.
Using NCBI's BLAST~\citep{blast} and reference database, the region aligned to the organism \emph{Nostoc} sp. PCC 7120.
Upon closer inspection, this region contained 16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA genes and was found at \emph{four} locations in \emph{Nostoc} sp. PCC 7120.
This region was only found once in the assembly, so all the sequences from the repeats aligned to this region, inflating the coverage.
This noticeable and consistent increase in coverage caused VALET to mark it as mis-assembled.
Unsurprisingly, QUAST did not mark this as a mis-assembly because the actual sequence within this region matched the reference.
