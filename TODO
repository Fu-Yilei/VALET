#VALET-Plans
* 9/30/2015 fixed bug with existing output directory
    - may want to add a "--force" argument to overwrite existing results directories
* Documentation
    - for test example
        + in readme add description of columns in results files
        + add reference for FRC curve figure
    - use cases
        + evaluation of a single metagenome assembly 
        + evaluating a set of assemblies
* optimizing parameters to reduce false discovery rates
    - Approach
        * go through results files and identify specific contigs for in-depth evaluation
            * mock community - should all be assembly errors, check for similarity between reference genomes
            * synthetic community - check alignment file for evidence of errors
        - characterize different types of errors - repeats, relocation, breakpoint ect.
            - VALET quast comparison results in `less /cbcb/project2-scratch/cmhill/metagenomes/mock/results/reference.suspicious.results`
        - read QUAST to evaluate method
        - read simulated dataset paper
    - Data and Results
        - using HMP Mock community data for validation  Bioproject - PRJNA48475  
            - perform assembly using metAMOS
            - align contigs processed by valet to whole genome assemblies to identify true errors
            - work out benchmarking methods
        - Chris's simulated datasets
            + data `/cbcb/project2-scratch/cmhill/metagenomes`
            + results `/cbcb/project2-scratch/cmhill/VALET2/mock_4321`
            + `run_mock.sh` used for genome assembly, `run_mock_valet.sh` - processing assemblies, `quast_pipeline.sh` running quast and comparing results to valet, `parse_quast.py` in `VALET/src/py` 
        - Shakya synthetic datasets
            + data `/cbcb/project2-scratch/sergek/metagenomes/run1/Assembly/out`
            + results `/cbcb/project2-scratch/cmhill/VALET-repo/synthetic_default`
